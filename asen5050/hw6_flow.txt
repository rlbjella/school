GIVEN: initial state (UTC, orbital elements)
1.	Compute initial mean anomaly
2. 	Create array of mean anomalies using orbital mean motion
3. 	Compute array of Greenwich sidereal time for each time
3. 	Compute true anomaly for each mean anomaly (gives all orbital elements
	for each time point)
4. 	Compute LLA from orbital elements at each time (elements to ECI, ECI to
	ECEF, ECEF to LLA)
5.	Plot it
6. 	For problem 2, use ECEF to TOPO function to find the first time elevation
	from Boulder is greater than zero (first pass over Boulder).
